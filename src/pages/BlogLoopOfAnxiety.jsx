          <p>Have you ever had a thought that just won’t leave you alone?</p>

          <p>You’re trying to relax, maybe scroll your phone or fall asleep — but your mind keeps replaying the same worry on loop. Something you said. Something that might go wrong. Something you <em>can’t quite solve.</em></p>

          <p>That’s not weakness or “overthinking.” It’s actually a built-in feature of your brain — a kind of <strong>mental loop</strong> designed to keep you safe. But when that loop gets stuck, we call it <em>anxiety.</em></p>

          <p>In this post, we’ll unpack how anxiety actually works in the brain, why your mind holds onto unfinished thoughts, what it has in common with songs that get stuck in your head — and even how <strong>AI tools</strong> can help us understand why we worry.</p>

          <hr />

          <h2>1. Anxiety Isn’t Fear — It’s Prediction</h2>

          <p>Fear is simple. You see danger, your body reacts, and the moment passes.</p>

          <p>Anxiety, though, is about <em>anticipation</em>. It’s your brain trying to <strong>predict</strong> what might go wrong — and prepare you to handle it.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>🧩 The <strong>amygdala</strong> acts as your internal alarm system.</li>
            <li>🧠 The <strong>prefrontal cortex</strong> tries to reason things out — plan, analyze, find solutions.</li>
            <li>🩶 The <strong>insula</strong> tracks what’s happening in your body — tightness, tension, racing heart.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>When your amygdala detects uncertainty, it fires up. Your prefrontal cortex starts asking <em>“What if?”</em> and tries to plan ahead.</p>

          <p>But if there’s <strong>no clear answer</strong>, the brain doesn’t close the file — and that’s when the loop begins. It keeps asking, <em>“What if…?”</em> over and over, searching for closure that never comes.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>“Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.” — Søren Kierkegaard</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Your mind spins when the future is open-ended — and your brain can’t stand unfinished business.</p>

          <hr />

          <h2>2. Why Your Brain Hates Unfinished Thoughts</h2>

          <p>In the 1920s, psychologist <strong>Bluma Zeigarnik</strong> noticed something strange. Waiters in a café could remember unpaid orders perfectly — but once the bill was paid, they forgot immediately.</p>

          <p>This became known as the <strong>Zeigarnik Effect</strong> — the tendency of the brain to hold onto <strong>unfinished tasks</strong>.</p>

          <p>It’s the same reason you can’t stop thinking about an unresolved argument, an unsent message, or a half-written email. Your brain labels it as “in progress” and keeps it active in memory — waiting for closure.</p>

          <p>When that “unfinished business” takes the form of a worry, it stays open like a browser tab you forgot to close. The more open tabs, the slower your mental system runs.</p>

          <p>That’s why <strong>writing down</strong> your worries, <strong>making a plan</strong>, or <strong>talking about them</strong> helps. These actions tell the brain:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>“We’re handling it. You can close this tab now.”</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>3. The Song Stuck in Your Head — and the Worry That Won’t Go Away</h2>

          <p>You know when a song gets stuck in your head? That’s called an <em>earworm</em> — and it happens for a similar reason.</p>

          <p>When you hear part of a song but don’t reach the end, your brain holds onto it. It keeps looping the melody, trying to complete the sequence.</p>
